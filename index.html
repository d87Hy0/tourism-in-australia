    <h1>Why does tourism matter to Australia?</h1>
    
    <h2>Economical statistics</h2>
      <p>Tourism in Australia has benefited the economy in many ways and is a major employer for Australians and has provided many jobs. Tourism is the fastest growing economic sector in Australia.</p>
      <p>In the year 2017-2018, tourism in Australia:</p>
      <li>makes up 3.1% of the national total GDP</li>
      <li>provides the employment of 5.2% of the Australian workforce, about 580,200 people working in the industry, and (roughly) equals to 1 in 20 jobs in Australia</li>
      <li>has exports of $37.4 billion internationally</li>
      <li>has imports of $54 billion from Australian citizens that travel overseas</li>
    
    <h2>Working with China</h2>
      <p>China is the largest source of inbound tourism (+24h but less than 1y stay) for Australia. The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (or ChAFTA for short) and China Approved Destination Scheme had a beneficial impact on this. The ADS for China means that Chinese tourists and citizens are able to travel to Australia as part of a guided tour group. Over 1 million Chinese tourists visited Australia in 2016, which was a 2x increase from 5 years before 2016. It is expected that the amount of Chinese tourists in Australia will only grow. It is believed that Chinese tourism would be worth $9 billion by 2020, with some experts believing a value of $13 billion. The government has been quick to take advantage of the increase of tourists from China.</p>
    
    <h2>Increasing countries and reasons to come to Australia in 2016</h2>
      <p>A study displays that in 2016, holidays and education were growing reasons as to why tourists travelled to Australia. The number of tourists from Japan grew almost double than the 2nd growing tourist country, Korea. The other reasons for tourists visiting Australia, like visiting family, employment, and business dropped. This shows that more tourists in that time have been visiting Australia for leisure or education.</p>

      <font size="-2">Source: Tourism Research Australia’s International Visitor Survey</font>
      <p>New South Wales is the most highest of arrival destinations for people visiting Australia.</p>
      <p>December is when the most people come to Australia, further backing the point that people want to leave the cold environment, and that most people go to Australia for holidays.</p>
    
    <h2>Investment</h2>
      <p>It really shows that tourism does matter to Australia, as the Australian Government has been investing and giving assistance with tourism in Australia. It prioritises tourism in one of the 5 national priorities in investment.</p>
    
    <h2>Tourism has rapidly increased in recent years</h2>
    <img src="https://www.budgetdirect.com.au/content/dam/budgetdirect/website-assets/2017/travel/content/graphs/Year-On-Year-Arrivals.jpg">
    <font size="-2">Source: Budget Direct Australian Tourism Statistics 2019</font>
    <p>As we can see from this source, tourism in Australia has spiked up in recent years. It is much more higher now than only about a decade ago, by about 4 million visitors.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Tourism matters to Australia because it improves the economy, and the Australian economy is significantly benefited from tourism. Australia profits from tourism which can be used to enhance and build more and better tourism places. It also provides employment for many people. Tourism in Australia has vastly improved and increased in the past years.</p>
